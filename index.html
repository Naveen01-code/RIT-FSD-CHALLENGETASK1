  <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>
  <p>
    This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.
    Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

  <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li>175g of tahini</li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><u>Instructions</u></h3>
  <h4>STEPS FOR MAKING QUICK HUMMUS:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
    <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste</li>
    <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
    <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
    <li>For a different flavour, you could try blending in lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Storage</h4>
  <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. Use within a week. Discard if it becomes fizzy.</p>
  <p>Hummus can be frozen and used within a couple of months after thawing.</p>
